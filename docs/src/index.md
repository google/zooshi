## Motivation

[Zooshi] demonstrates a quick and fun game that primarily targets
[Google Cardboard] using native C++ APIs. The game shows how to use
several open source technology components developed at Google.

<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_breadboard.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [Breadboard], an event system that allows game components to communicate
    with each other, without being tightly coupled.

<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_corgi.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [CORGI], a simple, yet flexible, [entity-component system][] that
    decouples the systems within the game.

<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_flatbuffers.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [FlatBuffers], a fast serialization system is used to store the game's
    data. The game configuration data is stored in JSON files which are
    converted to FlatBuffer binary files using the flatc compiler.

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_flatui.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [FlatUI], an immediate-mode GUI designed specifically with games in mind.
    The game uses FlatUI to generate all of the menus in the game.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_fplbase.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [fplbase], is as a thin renderer and asset management library used by the
    game.

<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_google_play_games.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [Google Play Games Services] is used to share scores and reward players
    with achievements.

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_mathfu_motive.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [MathFu], a geometry math library optimized for ARM and x86 processors.
    The game uses MathFu data types for two and three dimensional vectors, and
    for the 4x4 matrices used by the [fplbase] rendering system, and also by
    the [Motive] animation system.

    [Motive], a memory efficient and performant animation library. The game
    uses Motive for all of the animation.

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_pindrop.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [Pindrop], a simple audio engine designed with games in mind. It handles
    all the audio of the game.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="info_panel_scene_lab.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [Scene Lab][], an in-game world editor. This allows you to freeze the
    gameplay of the game and enter into an `edit` mode that allows you to move
    in-game objects, change object properties, etc.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
    <img src="https://github.com/google/zooshi/blob/master/docs/src/programmers_guide/info_panel_scene_lab.png" style="height: 20em"/>
    [WebP], an image compression technology, is used to compress textures
    which reduces the size of the final game package and ultimately reduces
    download time.
  </td>

In addition, [fplutil] is used to build, deploy, and run the game,
build and archive the game, and profile the game's CPU performance.
